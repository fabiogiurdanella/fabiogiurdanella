## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Fabio — a passionate backend developer and data engineer, always looking to build efficient, scalable, and meaningful solutions.

---

### 🔭 I’m currently working on...

I work primarily as a **backend developer**, leading the development of various projects built mainly with **Node.js** and **Python**.

My responsibilities range from designing simple management systems to implementing complex data processing platforms, event tracking systems, and custom reporting tools. Over the years, I’ve grown into the role of a **data engineer**, with a strong focus on **data pipelines**, **event tracking** for web and mobile platforms, and scalable backend services.

I'm proficient in **Docker** and well-versed in building solutions using a **microservices architecture**, which allows me to develop modular, maintainable, and distributed systems.
